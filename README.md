## What is Google Trends?

Google Trends is a free online tool that allows users to analyze the popularity of specific search queries over time and across regions. It provides real-time data on search terms, covering historical trends since 2004. Google Trends data is derived from an anonymous sample of Google search requests, which are grouped into different topics and normalized for easy comparison.

It is permissible to extract data from publicly accessible websites.
